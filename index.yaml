    description: 'Pangolin is a self-hosted tunneled reverse proxy server with identity
      and access control, designed to securely expose private resources on distributed
      networks. Acting as a central hub, it connects isolated networks — even those
      behind restrictive firewalls — through encrypted tunnels, enabling easy access
      to remote services without opening ports. '
